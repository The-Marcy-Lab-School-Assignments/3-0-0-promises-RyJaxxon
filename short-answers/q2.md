# Question

What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer

The main difference between these two is their use case. `.then()` is used specifically when fulfilling a promise, while `.catch()` is specifically used when that promise is rejected.

Additionally:

- `.then()` can take two optional arguments, the first is a callback function to handle the fulfilled promise, the second is an optional callback function we can add to handle the rejection case. Though this is usually done by using `.catch()` instead.
- `.catch()` only allows **one** argument as it's parameters. No more!

# Teacher Feedback

~~Their similarities are that they both take in a callback function! `.then` does not take in 2 callback functions, just the one, I think you were confusing the conditional we can add there to see if the response was okay!~~

My mistake! You are correct, double checked in the docs!
