# Question

With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling _and_ returning them

# Answer

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

Though option b would work, resolve and reject inherently return their values without the need for returning them. Return doesn't actually produce any value, it just returns what is there.
