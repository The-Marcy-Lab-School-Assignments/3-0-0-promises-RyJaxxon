# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

So I just learned this in more detail, but from what I understand JavaScript executes code in a certain order, this order is

- Synchronous tasks (`console.log('Outside promise')`)
- Micro-tasks (things like promises)
- Macro-tasks (overall scripts like setTimeout or setInterval)

When our code is executed, the first line creates a resolved promise and schedules the `console.log` as a micro-task, setting it behind in the queue. Next the second line is executed, since it's synchronous we see it immediately.
