# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer

The arguments we pass into resolve/reject become the data that they evaluate to if either is executed. We can use this data when using `.then()` or `.catch()`.

The data from resolve is used with `.then()` for when the promise is fulfilled.<br>
The data from reject is used with `.catch()` for when the promise is rejected.
